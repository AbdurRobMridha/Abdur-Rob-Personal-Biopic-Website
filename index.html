        <h2 id="early-life">Early Life</h2>

        <p>
          Abdur Rob was born on January 6th, 2002, in the district of Magura,
          located in the Khulna Division of Bangladesh. He grew up in a rural
          village in Mohammadpur upazila, surrounded by lush fields and a
          close-knit community. His upbringing was shaped by strong cultural
          values, family bonds, and a peaceful environment far from the hustle
          and bustle of city life.
        </p>

        <p>
          Abdur Rob comes from a middle-class family that placed great emphasis
          on honesty, education, and self-discipline. His father, a rural
          businessman, inspired by his honesty, while his mother, a devoted
          homemaker, nurtured his sense of empathy, patience, and moral
          grounding. Being the eldest child , Rob often took on responsibilities
          at home and learned to manage both academic and personal tasks from a
          young age.
        </p>

        <p>
          From early childhood, he showed curiosity about how things worked,
          often dismantling toys to explore their mechanisms. He developed a
          keen interest in mathematics and logical thinking while attending
          Chalimia Govt. Primary School. Teachers would often describe him as
          “quiet but inquisitive.” His early hobbies included Gardening,
          cycling, swimming and playing cricket with neighborhood friends.
        </p>

        <p>
          After completing his primary education, he enrolled in Babukhali Govt.
          High School, where he continued to excel in science and math. He
          participated in quiz competitions and took part in district-level
          science fairs. His strong performance in the SSC examination earned
          him a spot in district level, one of the country’s most competitive
          institutions for higher secondary education. During this time, he was
          introduced to basic programming through textbooks and online videos,
          which sparked his interest in computer science.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rob credits his childhood in a calm, disciplined environment — rich
          with community values and educational support — as the foundation of
          his academic mindset and personal growth.

        <p>
          <strong>Abdur Rob</strong> comes from a close-knit family in Magura, a
          district in the Khulna Division of Bangladesh. Growing up in a modest
          and value-driven household, he was taught the importance of
          discipline, education, and empathy from an early age. His upbringing
          in a rural environment shaped his strong sense of community and
          resilience.

          Outside academics, Rob is known for his calm nature, sincerity, and
          willingness to guide younger students, often offering support through
          tutoring and informal mentoring. He enjoys quiet time reading,
          reflecting, and learning new skills related to programming and
          personal development. He values simplicity, continuous growth, and
          contributing meaningfully to his surroundings.
