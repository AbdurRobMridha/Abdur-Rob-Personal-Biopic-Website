# Abdur-Rob-Personal-Biopic-Website
A personal biographical website inspired by Wikipedia-style pages, showcasing my academic journey, technical skills, projects, achievements, certifications, and more. Built with clean HTML/CSS and a minimal, accessible layout. This project highlights my experience in frontend development, self-branding, and community engagement.
